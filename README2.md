# Lab Assignment 2 — Operating Systems (ENCS351)

## Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation for Lab Assignment 2 (ENCS351 / Operating System).  
It demonstrates basic OS lab concepts using Python's `multiprocessing` and `logging` modules:
- Logging with timestamps and process names.
- Creating and running concurrent processes.
- Proper termination and joining of processes.
- Produces a log file `process_log.txt` as evidence of execution.

This implementation follows the lab instructions provided in the assignment sheet. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Files
- `os_lab_assignment2.py` — Main script. Creates processes, logs events, and writes `process_log.txt`.
- `process_log.txt` — Generated by running the script. Contains timestamped logs from parent and child processes.
- `README.md` — This document.

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+ (Python 3.8 or later recommended)
- No external packages required. Uses Python stdlib:
  - `multiprocessing`
  - `logging`
  - `time`
  - `random`

Tested on Linux and Windows. On Windows, ensure `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard is present (it is).
